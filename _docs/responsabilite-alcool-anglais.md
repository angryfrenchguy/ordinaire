**CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITY**

In Quebec, alcohol consumption is prohibited in any road vehicle, including buses,
as stipulated in section 443 of the highway safety code. The driver is
directly associated with  that offense under section 511 of that code.  

Consequently, the customer,  named below, accepts the full responsibility which may result of an offense, as described in section 443 of the highway safety code, and releases the driver of all responsibility in respect of article 511 of the safety code.  

This does not remove the responsibility for the driver and the group leader to keep the order inside the bus.  

The client also accepts full responsibility for fees that may result from a breakage or   extra cleaning of the vehicle.
